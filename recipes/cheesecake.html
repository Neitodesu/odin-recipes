        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Preheat the oven to 325°F (163°C). Grease a 9-inch springform pan.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make the crust: In a bowl, combine graham cracker crumbs and melted
            butter. Press the mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan. Bake
            for 10 minutes, then remove and set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Prepare the filling: Beat the cream cheese and sugar together in a
            large bowl until smooth. Add eggs one at a time, mixing well after
            each. Stir in the vanilla extract.
          </li>
          <li>
            Assemble the cheesecake: Pour the cream cheese mixture over the
            cooled crust in the springform pan.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake: Place the cheesecake in the oven and bake for 50-60 minutes,
            or until the edges are set but the center is slightly jiggly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cool: Turn off the oven and let the cheesecake cool in the oven with
            the door slightly ajar for 1 hour. Then transfer to the fridge and
            chill for at least 4 hours or overnight.
          </li>
          <li>
            Serve: Top with fresh fruit, chocolate, or your favorite topping,
            and enjoy!
