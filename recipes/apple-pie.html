      <p>
        This classic apple pie features a flaky, buttery crust filled with a
        sweet and spiced apple mixture. With cinnamon, nutmeg, and a hint of
        lemon, every bite is warm and comforting. Perfect for any occasion, it’s
        great on its own or served with vanilla ice cream for an extra treat!
