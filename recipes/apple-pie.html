        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>1. Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C).</li>
          <li>
            2. Prepare the filling: In a bowl, combine apples, sugars, lemon
            juice, cinnamon, nutmeg, and flour. Toss until apples are well
            coated.
          </li>
          <li>
            3. Assemble the pie: Place one pie crust in a 9-inch pie pan. Fill
            with the apple mixture and dot with butter. Place the second crust
            over the apples and crimp the edges to seal. Cut a few slits in the
            top to allow steam to escape.
          </li>
          <li>
            4. Bake: Bake for 45-50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown
            and the filling is bubbling.
          </li>
          <li>5. Cool: Let the pie cool for at least 1 hour before serving.</li>
          <li>
            6. Serve: Enjoy as is or with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or
            whipped cream!
